				What are the differences between Christian Life Coaching and
				counseling?
			</summary>
			<p class="faq-answer">
				The primary focal point of life coaching is on future performance
				and outcomes. It is therefore more proactive, solution-focused,
				collaborative, and forward-oriented in terms of personal and/or
				professional growth than traditional counseling and other mental
				health services. Psychotherapy tends to address past issues with
				the goal of symptom reduction, trauma work, and problem
				resolution. Coaches, on the other hand, endeavor to help unlock a
				person’s potential in order to maximize their performance, set and
				attain appropriate goals, and improve overall functioning in life.
				The change process is often viewed as having both a motivational
				and behavioral mindset where clients are not seen as individuals
				who need to be to be “fixed,” but those who have a capacity to
				envision and intentionally move toward new and higher goals. This
				indicates coaching is more about growth and not necessarily about
				clinical assessment, diagnosis or healing. Rather, it is a
				movement toward a healthier maturity instead of an unhealthy
				dependence on other things or people.

				What are the benefits of having an ICCI credential?
			</summary>
			<p class="faq-answer">
				Since coaching is largely an unregulated profession, Life Coaches
				frequently pursue voluntary certification and credentialing to
				show the public they have received an appropriate level of
				training, education, practice experience, and/or mentoring. We
				believe ICCI represents a premier faith-based network of Life
				Coaches that includes many of the leading Christian voices in the
				field today. Having an ICCI credential demonstrates a credible
				national level of competence, integrity, excellence, and
				recognition as having met rigorous standards, especially for those
				individuals who identify as Christian Life Coaches.

			<summary class="faq-question">
				What distinguishes an ICCI credential from other credentials in
				the field?
			</summary>
			<p class="faq-answer">
				Beyond a strong commitment to overall practice and ministerial
				excellence and professionalism, ICCI endeavors to faithfully
				integrate the Word of God and biblical principles into its
				training, resources, Member Benefits, events, and more. An ICCI
				credential represents a clear identity as a Christian Life Coach
				and has the backing and endorsement of many leading voices in the
				field today.

			<summary class="faq-question">
				How is an ICCI credential different than one from the
				International Coaching Federation (ICF)?
			</summary>
			<p class="faq-answer">
				Life coaching is an unregulated field, both within the United
				States and in most places around the world. As such, there are any
				number of coaching organizations (ICCI, ICF, etc.) that offer
				certification and credentialing opportunities. None of them are
				state or federally regulated entities, so individuals make choices
				about credentialing based primarily on a sense of affiliation and
				alignment with an organization’s values, core principles, and
				practices. ICCI’s foundational principles include the same core
				competencies as ICF and other reputable organizations. However,
				ICCI’s distinguishing characteristics are based on God’s Word and
				biblical principles to faithfully train and credential individuals
				who want to identify as “Christian” Life Coaches.

				What counts as field experience?
			</summary>

				Any coaching activity provided to clients, whether on a
				voluntary/pro bono or compensated basis, can qualify for
				appropriate field experience. This can be either ministry oriented
				or part of a professional life coaching practice.
