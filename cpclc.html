			<section id="faq" class="section-faq">

					<h4 class="gradient-text faq-title">Frequently Asked Questions</h4>
					<details>
						<summary class="faq-question">
							What are the differences between Christian Life Coaching and
							counseling?
						</summary>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							The primary focal point of life coaching is on future performance
							and outcomes. It is therefore more proactive, solution-focused,
							collaborative, and forward-oriented in terms of personal and/or
							professional growth than traditional counseling and other mental
							health services. Psychotherapy tends to address past issues with
							the goal of symptom reduction, trauma work, and problem
							resolution. Coaches, on the other hand, endeavor to help unlock a
							person’s potential in order to maximize their performance, set and
							attain appropriate goals, and improve overall functioning in life.
							The change process is often viewed as having both a motivational
							and behavioral mindset where clients are not seen as individuals
							who need to be to be “fixed,” but those who have a capacity to
							envision and intentionally move toward new and higher goals. This
							indicates coaching is more about growth and not necessarily about
							clinical assessment, diagnosis or healing. Rather, it is a
							movement toward a healthier maturity instead of an unhealthy
							dependence on other things or people.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary class="faq-question">
							What are the benefits of having an ICCI credential?
						</summary>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							Since coaching is largely an unregulated profession, Life Coaches
							frequently pursue voluntary certification and credentialing to
							show the public they have received an appropriate level of
							training, education, practice experience, and/or mentoring. We
							believe ICCI represents a premier faith-based network of Life
							Coaches that includes many of the leading Christian voices in the
							field today. Having an ICCI credential demonstrates a credible
							national level of competence, integrity, excellence, and
							recognition as having met rigorous standards, especially for those
							individuals who identify as Christian Life Coaches.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary class="faq-question">
							What distinguishes an ICCI credential from other credentials in
							the field?
						</summary>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							Beyond a strong commitment to overall practice and ministerial
							excellence and professionalism, ICCI endeavors to faithfully
							integrate the Word of God and biblical principles into its
							training, resources, Member Benefits, events, and more. An ICCI
							credential represents a clear identity as a Christian Life Coach
							and has the backing and endorsement of many leading voices in the
							field today.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary class="faq-question">
							How is an ICCI credential different than one from the
							International Coaching Federation (ICF)?
						</summary>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							Life coaching is an unregulated field, both within the United
							States and in most places around the world. As such, there are any
							number of coaching organizations (ICCI, ICF, etc.) that offer
							certification and credentialing opportunities. None of them are
							state or federally regulated entities, so individuals make choices
							about credentialing based primarily on a sense of affiliation and
							alignment with an organization’s values, core principles, and
							practices. ICCI’s foundational principles include the same core
							competencies as ICF and other reputable organizations. However,
							ICCI’s distinguishing characteristics are based on God’s Word and
							biblical principles to faithfully train and credential individuals
							who want to identify as “Christian” Life Coaches.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary class="faq-question">How will I take my courses?</summary>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							After purchase, courses and credential applications are served in
							your ICCI online dashboard. Just log into your account at
							iccicoaching.com at your convenience to complete your courses.
							Save your Certificates of Completion from each course to upload
							into your credentialing application.
						</p>
					</details>

					<details>
						<summary class="faq-question">
							What counts as field experience?
						</summary>
						<p class="faq-answer">
							Any coaching activity provided to clients, whether on a
							voluntary/pro bono or compensated basis, can qualify for
							appropriate field experience. This can be either ministry oriented
							or part of a professional life coaching practice.
